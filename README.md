# StarWarsRPG
Final project Text RPG
This is a Story led RPG following the story of a Padawan who is attempting to escape the inevitable. Travel throught the jedi temple as you gain Xp, Gain different abilities, find gold, fight clones, and eventually, fight the chosen one. They all end the same. This is the first time I have made an rpg so it is not super in depth story wise but I had a lot of fun and learned a lot making it! I hope you enjoy!
